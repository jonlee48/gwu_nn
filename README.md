# George Washington Neural Network
This repository contains a neural network library built from scratch for use in Neural Network courses at
The George Washington University. It is a basic implementation that provides a number of layers, activation
functions, and loss functions for students to explore how networks work at a low level. 

# Convolutional Neural Network
This branch adds CNN functionality to the GWU NN library for the final course project. Features implemented in 
this branch by Jonathan Lee. 

This branch will include code for inputting the image, implementing convolutional layers, pooling layers, and a flattening layer. The new layers will have to support forward and backward propagation as implemented in the GWU NN. I plan on training a network on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and comparing the model accuracy against some existing models.
